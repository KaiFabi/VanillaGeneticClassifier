# VanillaGeneticClassifier

A linear multi-class classification model can be trained relatively quickly using an evolutionary algorithm and can reach 91.77% (MNIST) and 83.72% (Fashionin-MNIST) of test accuracy.

You can find my post on the project [here](https://kaifabi.github.io/2020/01/17/train-a-simple-classifier-using-a-genetic-algorithm.html).
